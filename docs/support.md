# Unbind Support

Welcome to Unbind Support! We're here to help you get the most out of your productivity journey.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I record my first voice journal?**
A: Tap the microphone icon on the Record tab, speak for 30 seconds to 5 minutes about what's on your mind, then tap stop. Our AI will process your recording and generate personalized micro-tasks.

**Q: How long should my recordings be?**
A: We recommend 1-3 minutes for best results. The minimum is 30 seconds, and you can record up to 5 minutes.

**Q: What should I talk about?**
A: Talk about whatever is on your mind - tasks you need to do, challenges you're facing, goals you want to achieve, or feelings of overwhelm. The more context you provide, the better the AI can help.

### Account & Subscription

**Q: How does the free trial work?**
A: You get 3 days of full access with up to 10 sessions per day. No payment is required to start. You'll be reminded before the trial ends.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**
A: Go to Settings > Manage Subscription, or open the App Store app > tap your profile > Subscriptions > Unbind > Cancel Subscription.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: Refunds are handled by Apple. Go to reportaproblem.apple.com or contact Apple Support.

**Q: How do I restore my purchase on a new device?**
A: Go to Settings > Restore Purchases. Make sure you're signed in with the same Apple ID.

### Features

**Q: What are micro-tasks?**
A: Micro-tasks are small, actionable steps (2-30 minutes each) designed to help you overcome procrastination and build momentum. They're personalized based on what you share in your voice journal.

**Q: What is the Coach Insight?**
A: It's a personalized observation about patterns in what you shared - like having a coach who truly listens and understands your challenges.

**Q: Can I edit the tasks?**
A: Yes! You can mark tasks as complete, add new tasks, or remove tasks that don't fit.

**Q: Does Unbind work offline?**
A: You need an internet connection to process recordings (AI processing happens in the cloud). However, you can view your saved tasks and history offline.

### Privacy & Data

**Q: Is my voice data secure?**
A: Yes. Your recordings are encrypted during transmission, processed by AI, and transcripts are stored securely. We never share your personal data with advertisers.

**Q: Who can hear my recordings?**
A: Only you. Your voice is processed by OpenAI's transcription service (Whisper) and then deleted. The transcript is stored in your private account.

**Q: How do I delete my data?**
A: Go to Settings > Delete Account. This will permanently remove all your data.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app isn't recording my voice**
A: Make sure you've granted microphone permission. Go to your device Settings > Privacy > Microphone > Unbind and enable access.

**Q: Processing is taking too long**
A: Processing usually takes 10-30 seconds. If it's taking longer, check your internet connection and try again.

**Q: The app crashed**
A: Please restart the app. If the problem persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling. Your data is safely stored in the cloud.

**Q: I'm not getting notifications**
A: Check Settings > Notifications in the app, and also your device Settings > Notifications > Unbind.
